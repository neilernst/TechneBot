Techne - τέχνη - is a requirements modeling language that can manage preference and optional requirements in order to produce prioritized requirements solutions. [1]

TechneBot is a Google Wave bot that interacts with Techne models (in YAML markup), in order to 
* reason on them (is my model consistent? Does it admit a solution?)
* version them (store this solution; store Person A's model)
* find optimal solutions (given my preferences, what are possible solutions)
